# ds-helpers
Collection of helper functions for working on data science projects (primarily forecasting), and acts as a useful baseline for getting started with new projects.

I usually add to this repository over time with common functions that I often find myself using.

- helpers.py contains importsand functions for working in an IPython shell or Jupyter notebook.
- workon.bat emulates the workon command of virtualenvwrapper for Windows, which isn't available (obviously) for Conda environments.
- profiles.json is my current profile for Windows Terminal (which is amazing, you should use it!)
